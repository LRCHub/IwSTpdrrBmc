Oh, yesterday
I lost something I never had
But I wanted it so bad
I thought it might be fun to blow it up with you
And you never even knew
Had my hopes up higher than the sky
But now there's someone else
Keeping you up at night
Might as well get higher than a kite
Sigh, sigh, sigh

Sigh, Sigh, sigh
That feeling when
You lost something you never had
But you wanted it so bad
I was going to burn it to the ground with you
But none of this was true
Held my hopes up higher than the sky
But now there's someone else
Keeping you up at night
Might as well get higher than a kite

Sigh, sigh, sigh
Sigh, sigh, sigh
